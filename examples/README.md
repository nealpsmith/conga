This folder contains bash scripts for running the CoNGA pipeline on three
example datasets from 10x Genomics. To run these examples, you need to edit
the beginning of the `setup_all.bash` and `run_all.bash` scripts to point
to the locations where you downloaded the `conga` repository and to give the
appropriate path for `python` on your system.

You can download a folder containing the 10x datasets at the following link:

or individually from the 10x datasets webpage here:

The datasets are made available under a creative commons 3.0 attribution
license, as described in the `README.md` file contained within the zip folder above.
