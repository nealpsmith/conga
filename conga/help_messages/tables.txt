# graph_vs_graph_stats

Here we are assessing overall graph-vs-graph correlation by looking at
the shared edges between TCR and GEX neighbor graphs and comparing
that observed number to the number we would expect if the graphs were
completely uncorrelated. Our null model for uncorrelated graphs is to
take the vertices of one graph and randomly renumber them (permute their
labels). We compare the observed overlap to that expected under this null
model by computing a Z-score, either by permuting one of the graph's
vertices many times to get a mean and standard deviation of the overlap
distribution, or, for large graphs where this is time consuming,
by using a regression model for the
standard deviation. The different rows of this table correspond to the
different graph-graph comparisons that we make in the conga graph-vs-graph
analysis: we compare K-nearest-neighbor graphs for GEX and TCR at different
K values ("nbr_frac" aka neighbor-fraction, which reports K as a fraction
of the total number of clonotypes) to each other and to GEX and TCR "cluster"
graphs in which each clonotype is connected to all the other clonotypes with
the same (GEX or TCR) cluster assignment. For two K values (the default),
this gives 2*3=6 comparisons: GEX KNN graph vs TCR KNN graph, GEX cluster
graph vs TCR KNN graph, and GEX KNN graph vs TCR cluster graph, for each of the
two K values (aka nbr_fracs).

The column to look at is *overlap_zscore*. Higher values indicate more
significant GEX/TCR covariation, with "interesting" levels starting around
zscores of 3-5.

Columns in more detail:

graph_overlap_type: KNN ("nbr") or cluster versus KNN ("nbr") or cluster

nbr_frac: the K value for the KNN graph, as a fraction of total clonotypes

overlap: the observed overlap (number of shared edges) between GEX and TCR
graphs

expected_overlap: the expected overlap under a shuffled null model.

overlap_zscore: a Z-score for the observed overlap computed by subtracting
the expected overlap and dividing by the standard deviation estimaged from
shuffling.
